# DESCRIPTION 

# 📂 Java File Handling Utility.

A simple **console-based Java application** to demonstrate basic file operations like **writing**, **reading**, and **modifying** a text file (`sample.txt`). This project is great for beginners looking to understand Java's file I/O capabilities.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Write user input to a file (append mode)
- ✅ Read and display file content
- ✅ Modify a specific line in the file
- ✅ Menu-driven user interface via console
- ✅ Built-in exception handling

---

## 🧠 How It Works

This application performs operations on a text file using standard Java I/O libraries. It gives users a terminal menu to:

1. Append new lines to the file
2. Read the entire content of the file
3. Modify any line by its line number

---

## 📋 Use Case

Useful for learning:
- Java file handling (`BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`)
- Console-based user interaction (`Scanner`)
- Exception handling (`IOException`)
- Line-by-line text processing
